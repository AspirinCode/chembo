# Notes

## On initial pool size:

initial pool size is determined by init_capital (it's either that or 2 * init_capital). In options, it is set to default;
in ExperimentDesigner, it is set depending on available capital and dimension of domain, but no less than 5
(in our case, always chosen to be 5)
